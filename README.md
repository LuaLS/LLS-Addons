Welcome to the repository of [addons][addon-wiki] for the [Lua Language Server][lls-github] by [sumneko](https://github.com/sumneko)!

This repository is a highly collaborative project, with the community contributing addons through pull requests. The goal is to provide a central location where the community can collaborate on creating addons. Addons are added to this repository as a git submodule, allowing each project to have its own issues, pull requests, and fork-able repo - they can even live on GitLab. The addons in this repository can be fetched by the [addon manager](https://github.com/LuaLS/lua-language-server/wiki/Addons#vs-code-addon-manager) in the [VS Code extension](https://github.com/sumneko/vscode-lua) that communicates with the Lua Language Server in VS Code.

## What is an Addon?
An [addon](https://github.com/LuaLS/lua-language-server/wiki/Addons), simply put, is something that extends the functionality of the [Lua Language Server][lls-github]. An addon could, for example, include definitions for an API, and apply settings. Definition files are written in Lua using the Lua Language Server's [LuaCATS annotation system](https://github.com/sumneko/lua-language-server/wiki/Annotations).

### What should be an Addon?
- An [addon][addon-wiki] for a popular library/framework.
- Definitions for an API

### What should **NOT** be an Addon?
- Definitions for a personal project (use [`workspace.library`](https://github.com/sumneko/lua-language-server/wiki/Settings#workspacelibrary)).
- Definitions for proprietary software.

### Anatomy of an Addon
Here is an example of what an addon could look like:
```
üìÇ MySnazzyAddon/
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄüìú info.json
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ üìÅ module/
        ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ üìÅ library/
        ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ üìú config.lua
```
#### `info.json`
The `info.json` file contains some details about the addon such as the name and description. It also contains some additional metadata such as `size` and `hasPlugin`, but these values are generated automatically by the [LLS-Addons-Action](https://github.com/LuaLS/LLS-Addons-Action). This file is used by the [addon manager](https://github.com/LuaLS/lua-language-server/wiki/Addons#vs-code-addon-manager) to retrieve some data about each addon without having to install them all first.

#### `module`
The module folder is the submodule that contains the [addon][addon-wiki]'s definition files and `config.json`.

## Get Involved
